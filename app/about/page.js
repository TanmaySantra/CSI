        The seed for the Computer Society of India (CSI) was first shown in the
        year 1965 with a handful of IT enthusiasts who were a computer user
        group and felt the need to organize tteir activities. They also wanted
        to share their knowledge and exchange ideas on what they felt was a fast
        emerging sector. Today the CSI takes pride in being the largest and most
        professionally managed association of and for IT professionals in India.
        The purposes of the Society are scientific and educational directed
        towards the advancement of the theory and practice of computer science
        and IT. The organisation has grown to an enviable size of 100,000 strong
        members consisting of professionals with varied backgrounds including
        Software developers, Scientists, Academicians, Project Managers, CIO’s ,
        CTO’s & IT vendors to just name a few. It has spread its branches all
        over the country. Currently having 488 student branches and rooted
        firmly at 73 different locations, CSI has plans of opening many more
        chapters & activity centers in smaller towns and cities of the country.
        The idea is to spread the knowledge, and provide opportunities to as
        many interested as possible.
